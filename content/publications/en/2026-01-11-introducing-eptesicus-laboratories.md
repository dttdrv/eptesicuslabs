## The Cloud-First Problem

Cloud AI is easy to start with, but expensive and restrictive to scale. Every token costs money, every request exposes data, and every outage breaks your product. As AI becomes central to more applications, these constraints compound into serious business risks.

Meanwhile, small language models have improved dramatically—but many still struggle with consistency and safe failure modes, which blocks serious deployment. The gap between "works in a demo" and "works in production" remains wide.

## Our Thesis

On-device deployment will give teams control over cost, privacy, and availability. But it only works when models are efficient and behavior is reliable. That's the problem we intend to solve.

Eptesicus Laboratories will develop small language models optimized for strong performance per compute, paired with reliability engineering so enterprises can ship on-device intelligence with confidence.

## What We Will Build

Our approach will have three pillars:

**Model R&D** — Improving capability per compute in small language models, measured against public baselines and internal evaluations.

**Reliability Infrastructure** — Datasets and evaluation harnesses that catch regressions and quantify improvements. We will wrap models with a deterministic Validator Council that checks safety, factual accuracy, and structural compliance before outputs reach users.

**Deployment Pathways** — Packaging, controls, and integration patterns that work for enterprise and OEM/ISV distribution.

## The Path Forward

We're building toward a world where AI runs primarily on customer-controlled hardware—where small models are both capable and dependable.

Eptesicus Laboratories will build a portfolio of on-device models and reliability tooling that can be licensed, bundled, and supported at scale. We will also release community-facing applications that prove the on-device experience can feel top-tier.
